Abstract
Simple random sampling is a widely utilized sampling method in quantitative studies with survey
instruments. It is asserted that simple random sampling is favorable in homogeneous and
uniformly selected populations. In this selection method, all the individuals have an equal
opportunity to participate in the study where the selection process is entirely based on luck. The
simple random sampling has benefits and drawbacks associated with it. It ensures unbiased,
representative, and equal probability of the population; on the other hand, it can be
cumbersome, rarely supported with readily available list of population, and challenging when
population is heterogeneous and widely dispersed.

Introduction
The population is the entire group of subjects the researcher wants information on (Stockemer,
2019); ideally, it is preferable to include whole population to investigate an issue; however,
“practically, it is always not possible to study the entire population” (Acharya, 2013, p. 330). The
size of the population under consideration is typically taken into account when determining an
acceptable sample size. Therefore, we attempt to select a ‘sample’ that represents the population
under study. Researchers will use sampling as a technique (procedure or device) to systematically
choose a smaller group of representative objects or people (a subset) from a pre-defined
population to act as subjects (data sources) for observation or experimentation in accordance with
the goals of their study (Sharma, 2017). It is significantly important for the researcher to make
sure that the selected sample is neither too big nor two small. Contrary to popular belief, samples
should not be too small or too large in the ideal scenario (Faber & Fonseca, 2014). According to
Miles & Huberman (1994), it is crucial to be specific about what you intent to study and why you
are inclined to conduct that study. “Otherwise you may suffer the pitfalls of vacuum-cleaner-like

collection of every datum. You may suffer accumulation of more data than there is time to analyze
and detours into alluring associated questions that waste time, goodwill and analytic opportunity”
(p. 3).
Simple random sampling requires the researcher to define carefully the population from
which the sample is drawn. It is necessary to provide a framework for inclusion and exclusion of
population; for instance, Cohen et al. (2018) assert that “it is little help in trying to generalize to
all the males and females in a school if only males are taken as the population from which the
sample is drawn” (p. 215). This article mainly focuses on defining simple random sampling and
explaining its pros and cons in scientific research. The following research questions guide this
study:
1. What is simple random sampling in scientific research?
2. How can researchers frame simple random sampling?
3. What are the inherent benefits and drawbacks of simple random sampling in scientific
research?
Defining Simple Random Sampling in a Scientific Research
Simple random sampling is an extensively used sampling method in scientific research. Simple
random sampling is selected for populations which are highly homogenous where the members
of the research are randomly selected to participate in the research (Bhardwaj, 2019). Simple
Random Sampling is the “simplest and most common method of selecting a sample, in which the
sample is selected unit by unit, with equal probability of selection for each unit at each draw”
(Singh, 2003, p. 71). According to Acharya (2013), “In this method, every individual has an equal
chance of being selected in the sample from the population” (p. 330). Simple random sampling
makes sure that every person in a population has an equal probability of being chosen as a
response (Thomas, 2020). Moreover, in this method, researcher develops a numeric list of all
sample size and by using computer program generate random numbers when they deal with large
sample size (Rahi, 2017; Omair, 2014) which will provide them a list of population for the intended
research project.
Due to likelihood and chance, the sample should include individuals who share traits with
the general population, including some who are elderly, some who are young, tall, some who are
short, fit, some who are unfit, wealthy, and some who are poor (Cohen et al., 2018). Thus, in simple
random sampling, the researcher needs to specify the general common characteristics of the
individuals that can participate in the study.
Framing Simple Random Sampling
Simple random sampling is often utilized in surveys and quantitative research designs (Rahi, 2017).
As in simple random sampling individuals get equal opportunity to participate in the study. It is
favorable in studies where the population is homogenous and population of the study are
uniformly distributed.
Ansar et al. (2017) conducted a study in Gorontalo, Indonesia, where they collected data
from all high school English teachers, numbering 123. The study intended to find out if there was
79 | P ageNoor et al.
a direct positive influence of school culture on the performance of high school English teachers in
Gorontalo province or not. The researchers opted for simple random sampling for their study
where they had pre-determined criteria of having a) all high school English teachers, b) be current
teachers, c) be willing to answer the survey questions.
Benefits and Drawbacks of Simple Random Sampling
As in any sampling method, there are benefits and drawback in opting for simple random sampling
as well. Simple random sampling is a widely utilized sampling method in studies with large number
of participants. Since in simple random sampling data selection depends on luck, it is possible that
the data obtained from the research may lead to precise generalizable results. According to Best
and Kahn (2016), simple random sampling is a cumbersome and rarely used procedure in research
design. Moreover, it is asserted that this sampling method is efficient when the population is
homogeneous and the list of the population intended for the study is readily available (Cohen et
al., 2018; Barreiro & Albandoz, 2001). In addition, random selection can easily result in subsets
that do not adequately cover the data in more complicated (non-uniformly distributed) datasets,
which will result in a high variance in the estimation of the model error (Reitermanova’, 2010).
Furthermore, when the population's size in a particular demographic is not defined, then this
method cannot run properly. And for this, different areas such as research on animals are in the
field area; this method is not that useful (Rahman et al., 2022).
On the other hand, ideally, such randomization techniques give every individual in the population
the same chance to be selected in the sample (Stockemer, 2019). It is also an unbiased and
impartial selection method (Sharma, 2017; Fink, 2003); when cautiously designed, the sample can
be representative of the whole population. Stockemer asserts that randomization helps to offset
the confounding effects of known and unknown factors by randomly choosing cases (2019) which
may lead to a more considerate sample selection process for the intended study.

Closing Remarks
Simple random sampling is a probability sampling method which provides researchers with an
opportunity to select participants for their study randomly and without a bias. The findings of this
paper proclaim that simple random sampling is favorable and supportive for quantitative studies.
Simple random sampling provides impartial, representative, and offset confounding effects of
known and unknown factors for the population of the study; it is also subject to sampling error,
unwieldly procedure, and problematic with heterogeneous and dispersed population.

Simple random sampling requires the researcher to define carefully the population from
which the sample is drawn. It is necessary to provide a framework for inclusion and exclusion of
population; for instance, Cohen et al. (2018) assert that “it is little help in trying to generalize to
all the males and females in a school if only males are taken as the population from which the
sample is drawn” (p. 215). This article mainly focuses on defining simple random sampling and
explaining its pros and cons in scientific research. The following research questions guide this
study:
1. What is simple random sampling in scientific research?
2. How can researchers frame simple random sampling?
3. What are the inherent benefits and drawbacks of simple random sampling in scientific
research?
Defining Simple Random Sampling in a Scientific Research
Simple random sampling is an extensively used sampling method in scientific research. Simple
random sampling is selected for populations which are highly homogenous where the members
of the research are randomly selected to participate in the research (Bhardwaj, 2019). Simple
Random Sampling is the “simplest and most common method of selecting a sample, in which the
sample is selected unit by unit, with equal probability of selection for each unit at each draw”
(Singh, 2003, p. 71). According to Acharya (2013), “In this method, every individual has an equal
chance of being selected in the sample from the population” (p. 330). Simple random sampling
makes sure that every person in a population has an equal probability of being chosen as a
response (Thomas, 2020). Moreover, in this method, researcher develops a numeric list of all
sample size and by using computer program generate random numbers when they deal with large
sample size (Rahi, 2017; Omair, 2014) which will provide them a list of population for the intended
research project.
Due to likelihood and chance, the sample should include individuals who share traits with
the general population, including some who are elderly, some who are young, tall, some who are
short, fit, some who are unfit, wealthy, and some who are poor (Cohen et al., 2018). Thus, in simple
random sampling, the researcher needs to specify the general common characteristics of the
individuals that can participate in the study.
Framing Simple Random Sampling
Simple random sampling is often utilized in surveys and quantitative research designs (Rahi, 2017).
As in simple random sampling individuals get equal opportunity to participate in the study. It is
favorable in studies where the population is homogenous and population of the study are
uniformly distributed.
Ansar et al. (2017) conducted a study in Gorontalo, Indonesia, where they collected data
from all high school English teachers, numbering 123. The study intended to find out if there was

a direct positive influence of school culture on the performance of high school English teachers in
Gorontalo province or not. The researchers opted for simple random sampling for their study
where they had pre-determined criteria of having a) all high school English teachers, b) be current
teachers, c) be willing to answer the survey questions.
Benefits and Drawbacks of Simple Random Sampling
As in any sampling method, there are benefits and drawback in opting for simple random sampling
as well. Simple random sampling is a widely utilized sampling method in studies with large number
of participants. Since in simple random sampling data selection depends on luck, it is possible that
the data obtained from the research may lead to precise generalizable results. According to Best
and Kahn (2016), simple random sampling is a cumbersome and rarely used procedure in research
design. Moreover, it is asserted that this sampling method is efficient when the population is
homogeneous and the list of the population intended for the study is readily available (Cohen et
al., 2018; Barreiro & Albandoz, 2001). In addition, random selection can easily result in subsets
that do not adequately cover the data in more complicated (non-uniformly distributed) datasets,
which will result in a high variance in the estimation of the model error (Reitermanova’, 2010).
Furthermore, when the population's size in a particular demographic is not defined, then this
method cannot run properly. And for this, different areas such as research on animals are in the
field area; this method is not that useful (Rahman et al., 2022).
On the other hand, ideally, such randomization techniques give every individual in the population
the same chance to be selected in the sample (Stockemer, 2019). It is also an unbiased and
impartial selection method (Sharma, 2017; Fink, 2003); when cautiously designed, the sample can
be representative of the whole population. Stockemer asserts that randomization helps to offset
the confounding effects of known and unknown factors by randomly choosing cases (2019) which
may lead to a more considerate sample selection process for the intended study.

Closing Remarks
Simple random sampling is a probability sampling method which provides researchers with an
opportunity to select participants for their study randomly and without a bias. The findings of this
paper proclaim that simple random sampling is favorable and supportive for quantitative studies.
Simple random sampling provides impartial, representative, and offset confounding effects of
known and unknown factors for the population of the study; it is also subject to sampling error,
unwieldly procedure, and problematic with heterogeneous and dispersed population.
